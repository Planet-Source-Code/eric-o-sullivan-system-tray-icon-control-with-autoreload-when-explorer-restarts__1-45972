## System Tray Icon Control With AutoReload When Explorer Restarts


</div>

### Description

This is a standard system tray icon control with a "rare" feature in that it can detect when it should reload itself when explorer restarts. Have you ever noticed that when explorer.exe crashes and reloads, that most of the system tray icons don't reload? Well, now you can reload your icon automatically. Usefull, but I can't take full credit for the code. I got some of the code from a web site (the address is in the module header in the code). Any votes/suggestions welcome of course :-)
